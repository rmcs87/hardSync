DAL - Dinamic Aligned List


The Dinamic Aligned List - DAL - was designed in order to store efficientilly all relevant contributions that represent a temporal relation between a pair of videos. 

This structure is based on a Upper Triangular Matrix, although, the DAL is contructed on demmand, saving space because don't have any empty slot on it.

Additionally, the DAL is a very usefull structure for algorithms because can be browsed and every position in it contains a not null value.
